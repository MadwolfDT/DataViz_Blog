# 1. Introduction


Merchandise Trade data collated by the Department of Statistics Singapore comprised of total imports/ exports since January 1976. The data is segregated into various regions and countries. We were given a graph depicting the merchandise trade imports/exports for six countries over 2019 and 2020.

# 2. Visualisation Critiques

## 2.1 Clarity

### 2.1.1 **No Clarity in Title**
The title suggested *Merchandise Trading of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019 - 2020*. However, it was not clear in suggesting how the six countries were accounted for, as top six trading countries. For a layman, the ambiguity could suggest that the countries could be defined as top six trading countries by total import/export trading volume, total import/export trading value, total import volume/ value, total export volume/ value etc.

### 2.1.2 **No Clarity on Period of Measure**
The title suggested a period of measure, *2019 - 2020*. However, under the period scale (x-axis) for the countries, month of period (2019 to 2021), less Japan, was shown. While the title suggested *month of period*, no indications of months were provided.

### 2.1.3 **Incomplete Data Visualisation for Japan**
The title suggested that the data would comprise of data from 2019 to 2020. However, under the chart depicting Japan, only "2020" was shown at *Month of Period*.

## 2.2 Aesthestics

### 2.2.1 **Unsuitable Usage of Colours**

### 2.2.2 **Inept for Intuitive Comparison Among Countries**

### 2.2.3 **Inconsistent Intervals across Charts**

### 2.2.4 **Inconsistent Intervals within Chart**

### 2.2.5 **Missing Intervals to Indicate Month of Period**
