The data is segregated into various regions and countries. We were given a graph depicting the merchandise trade imports/exports for six countries over 2019 and 2020.\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Original Visualisation depicting trades of six countries from 2019 - 2020\r\n2. Visualisation Critiques\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\n2.1.1 No Clarity in Title\r\nThe title suggested Merchandise Trading of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019 - 2020. However, it was not clear in suggesting how the six countries were accounted for, as top six trading countries. For a layman, the ambiguity could suggest that the countries could be defined as top six trading countries by total import/export trading volume, total import/export trading value, total import volume/ value, total export volume/ value etc.\r\n2.1.2 No Clarity on Period of Measure\r\nThe title suggested a period of measure, 2019 - 2020. However, under the period scale (x-axis) for the countries, month of period (2019 to 2021), less Japan, was shown. While the title suggested month of period, no indications of months were provided.\r\n2.1.3 Incomplete Data Visualisation for Japan\r\nThe title suggested that the data would comprise of data from 2019 to 2020. However, under the chart depicting Japan, only “2020” was shown at Month of Period.\r\n2.2 Aesthestics\r\n2.2.1 Incorrect Usage of Graphs\r\nThe graphs attempted to use an area graph to depict the import and export values of the respective countries. Such area graph is suitable to depict profit over revenue, when we need visualisation to suggest when would the revenue turn profitable. In addition, profit is a result from revenue, after taking into account other costs and expenses. However, imports and exports are not a result from either one another. Therefore, such a graph is not suitable to depict the import/export value.\r\n2.2.2 Unsuitable Usage of Colours\r\nThe graphs attempted to use 2 colours to differentiate between import and export value. However, using an incorrect graph will see the value of imports and exports being overlaid with each other, forming a different shade of colour. Although only two colours were used, a third shade of colour appeared, thus creating confusion for readers.\r\n2.2.3 Inept for Intuitive Comparison Among Countries\r\nThe graphs are separated into six different charts and it does not allow the users to intuitively compare the import/export values among the countries. In addition, the reader is unable to comprehend the the pegging order of the six countries, in terms of the total value of import and export for the period 2019 to 2020.\r\n2.2.4 Inconsistent Intervals across and within Charts\r\nAt first glance, the six different charts may suggest that the six countries are having similar trade value from 2019 - 2020. However, upon closer examination, the charts do not have a consistent intervals for the Export value. Similarly, a quick glance may suggest that trade value between imports and exports seem to differ slightly. But it was attributed to different interval scales within the chart itself. Such inconsistencies would not allow the reader to pick up the correct information, and worse, misled the readers.\r\n2.2.5 Missing Intervals to Indicate Month of Period\r\nThe x-axis of the graphs was labelled as \"Month of Period. However, there are no interval ticks to suggest to indicate the various months.\r\n3. Proposing an Improved Visualisation\r\nWith the above critiques, I would be suggesting an alternate graphical presentation to better present the data to a wider audience. The proposed layout of the improved visualisation is as stated below:\r\n The improved visualisation would achieve the following:\r\n4. The Improved Viualisation\r\nThe improved visualisation would address all the critiques and provide visual enhancements. The improvements include:\r\nProviding clarity in the title heading, to suggest that the top size countries were chosen based on total trade value, imports and exports, from 2019 to 2020. This is further enhanced by sorting the countries by their trade value.\r\nProviding interval marks for months of period from 2019 to 2020, to allow reader to have an indication the trade value (import/export) for the particular month made by a specific country.\r\nEnsuring all six countries depicts the trade value from 2019 to 2020.\r\nProviding 3 separate charts to allow reader to visualise the data better:\r\nChart 1: Using horizontal bar chart to displaying the total trade value (imports and exports) from 2019 to 2020, sorted in descending order for trade value.\r\nChart 2: Using line graph to depict the import value of various countries, differntiated by varying colours, from 2019 to 2020.\r\nChart 3: Using line graph to depict the export value of various countries, differntiated by varying colours, from 2019 to 2020.\r\n\r\nThe import and export chart would use consistent intervals at the y-axis across both charts, so as to allow the reader to:\r\nIntuitively compare the trade value among the six countries.\r\nIntuitively compare the import and export value of the same country.\r\nIntuitively rank the countries in accordance to trade value, import value and export value, separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Step-by-Step Description on how the Improved Visualisation was prepared\r\n5.1 Data Preparation\r\n5.1.1 Using Tableau Data Interpreter\r\n\r\nTableau Data Interpreter will attempt to identify the structure of the Excel file and convert it into a suitable format for Tableau processing. There are 3 worksheets inside the Excel file, Content, T1 and T2. For thise exercise, we will be using T1 and T2.\r\n5.1.2 Preparing T1 and T2\r\nUpon examining T1, it was observed that it contains all the Merchandise Trading Imports from various countries and regions from Jan 1976. However, the data is organised such that every observations (rows) represents the trade value of a specific country/ region from Jan 1976. This would not be suitable for our analysis. Therefore, there is a need to pivot the data such that we have two variables, Month of Trade and Value. To pivot the table:\r\nSelect all observations, less Variables\r\nRight-click and select Pivot\r\n\r\n5.1.3 Adjust Variable Names and Types\r\nMonth of Period\r\nWhile the Month of Period of import is recorded as Month (MMM) and Year (YYYY), Tableau identified it as a string format. Therefore, there is a need to adjust it into a Date format. To do this:\r\nClick on the Abc\r\nClick on Date\r\n * Rename the Dimension as Month (Import)\r\nRename Variables\r\nThe countries/ regions are described as Variables. To rename:\r\nClick on the Column\r\nRight-Click and choose Rename\r\nTYpe Country (Import)\r\n\r\nCreating Calculated Field\r\nThe Merchandise Trading Value are depicted in Thousands of Dollars (’000). To depict the exact value for computation and display, we need to create a calculated field. To do this:\r\nHover the cursor to the down-arrow at the column variable\r\nClick on Create Calculated Field\r\nName it as Import Value\r\nUnder the input box, type [Pivot Field Values] * 1000\r\nClick on OK\r\n\r\nA new column, Import Value would be created, with the adjusted value.\r\n\r\nNow that the Data Preparation for T1 is completed, proceed to do the same for T2 that accounts for the Merchandise Trading Export Value.\r\nEstablishing Table Relationships\r\nThere is a need to build the relationship model between both tables. To do so:\r\nDrag T1 and T2 into top window pane\r\nClick on the link, connecting between T1 and T2\r\nLink Country (Import) with Country (Export)\r\nLink Month (Import) with Month (Export)\r\n\r\n5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis\r\nThere is a need to examine the data, to determine whether the six countries, highlighted, are indeed the top six countries in terms of total Merchandise Trading Value for 2019 to 2020.\r\nCreate a new worksheet, naming it as Total 6 Countries, and create a new calculated field.\r\nUnder the Data Pane, click on the down arrow \r\nClick on Create Calculated Field\r\nType Total Import/Export Value for the Dimension Name\r\nUnder the input box, type [Import Value] + [Export Value] \r\nClick OK\r\nNow we are ready to create the first Data Visualisation Worksheet.\r\n5.2.1 Exploring the Top Six Countries\r\nWe need to narrow the data to contain only records from 2019 to 2020. We can use the filter option to achieve this. To do this:\r\nDrag the Month (Import) into the Filter Pane, and then choose Years and click Next. Select 2019 and 2020 and click OK.\r\n\r\nTo create the visualisation graph:\r\nDrag the Total Import/Export Value to Columns\r\nDrag the Country (Import) to Rows\r\nClick on Country (Import) down arrow and choose Sort\r\nUnder Sort By, choose Field\r\nUnder Sort Order, choose Descending\r\nUnder Field Name, choose Total Import/Export Value\r\n\r\n5.2.2 Filter Out all Countries, less the Top Six\r\nNow that we know that Malaysia, China, US, Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong are our top six countries with the highest trade value (import and export) for 2019 and 2020, we will filter out all other countries. To do so:\r\nDrag the Country (Import) into the Filter pane\r\nClick on None to deselect all countries\r\nSearch for the six countries and manually check their boxes\r\nEnsure all 6 countries are selected\r\nClick OK\r\n\r\n5.2.3 Finalising Total Trade Value Graph\r\nSegregating 2019 from 2020\r\nInstead of displaying the total trade value from 2019 to 2020, it would be useful to split the data into 2019 and 2020. To do so:\r\nDrag the Month(Import) into the Color button\r\nA window would appear. Click on Add all members \r\nIncluding Labels\r\nIt would be useful to add data into the graph To do so:\r\nClick on Labels\r\nCheck on the box, Show mark labels\r\nSort the Year\r\nIntuitively, a reader would read from left to right. Therefore, it would be more intuitive to display 2019 data, followed by 2020 data, on the graph. To do so:\r\nClick on the down arrow at the legend\r\nUnder Sort Order, choose Descending \r\nEdit Title and Alias\r\nThere is a need to correctly label the title. To do so, double click on the Total 6 Countries and change it to Top Six Countries, based on Total Merchandise Import and Export Value for 2019 to 2020\r\nTo edit the Y-Axis labels:\r\nRight click on the label, and click on Edit Alias\r\n5.2.4 Graph 1: Top Six Countries, based on Total Merchandise Import and Export Value for 2019 to 2020\r\nThe final graph should look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
